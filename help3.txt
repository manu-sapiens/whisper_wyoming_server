we are capturing audio in the client @index.html and @client.js then sending it to the server to be converted to 16khz and sent for transcription using a wyoming protocol @stt.py 
However, every converted audio file seems to be missing about .5 to 1s at its end

Here's an example of the generated files:

out of those, the very small ones are corrupted (100% random numbers but as a valid wav file).
The missing part and the corrupted audio files are probably related.
